          <p style="font-size:x-large;" class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> Hurling is a field sport played mostly in Ireland. A hurling game consists of two teams for 15 players who use hurleys made out of wood to try and put the ball over the bar and between thw uprights for one point or in to the back of the net for three points. The only protective gear hurlers wear is a helmet to protect their head. In my eyes hurling is the perfect balance of power and skill and for these reasons hurling is my favourite sport. The hurling team that i support is Cork, last year i did not miss one Cork championship game including the Munster final which they won, after that game we stormed the pitch and the atmosphere was absolutly electric. I currently play hurling with Fermoy G.A.A. at under 21 and Intermediate level. We usually train two nights a week, Monday and Friday. </p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;"  class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> Football is a sport that is mainly played in Ireland. It consists of 2 teams of 15 players fighting it out to have the highest points tally at the end of the game. To score a single point a player must either kick or handpass the ball between the uprights and over the crossbar and a player can score 3 points for his team by kicking the ball into the back of the net passed the goalkeeper. I play football with my local club Fermoy at Premier intermediate level, I play on the college fresher football team here in U.C.C. and I also represent my county (Cork) at under 20 level this is a massive achievement for me because i am only 18 and I can play on this team for the next two years. I train for football nearly every night of the week amd then when we aren't on the field playing football we are in the gym so for me right now its almost like a job, and this is the main reason that I prefer Hurling to Football</p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;" class= "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. I used to play soccer as a kid as a striker or goalkeeper. The team I would suppose is Liverpool, they aren't going too well lately but hopefully they will pick up in the future and get back to winnig ways, but if they dont I'll still support them. My favourite player is Lionel Messi, because he is the best player in the world and he plays the game so gracefully that he makes it look effortless when he plays. Soccer is also the biggest and most played sport in the world. </p>
