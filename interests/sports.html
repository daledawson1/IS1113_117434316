          <p style="font-size:x-large;" class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> Hurling is a field sport played mostly in Ireland. A hurling game consists of two teams for 15 players who use hurleys made out of wood to try and put the ball over the bar and between thw uprights for one point or in to the back of the net for three points. The only protective gear hurlers wear is a helmet to protect their head. In my eyes hurling is the perfect balance of power and skill and for these reasons hurling is my favourite sport. The hurling team that i support is Cork, last year i did not miss one Cork championship game including the Munster final which they won, after that game we stormed the pitch and the atmosphere was absolutly electric. I currently play hurling with Fermoy G.A.A. at under 21 and Intermediate level. We usually train two nights a week, Monday and Friday. </p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;"  class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> Football is a sport that is mainly played in Ireland. It consists of 2 teams of 15 players fighting it out to have the highest points tally at the end of the game. To score a single point a player must either kick or handpass the ball between the uprights and over the crossbar and a player can score 3 points for his team by kicking the ball into the back of the net passed the goalkeeper. I play football with my local club Fermoy at Premier intermediate level, I play on the college fresher football team here in U.C.C. and I also represent my county (Cork) at under 20 level this is a massive achievement for me because i am only 18 and I can play on this team for the next two years. I train for football nearly every night of the week amd then when we aren't on the field playing football we are in the gym so for me right now its almost like a job, and this is the main reason that I prefer Hurling to Football</p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;" class= "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. I used to play soccer as a kid as a striker or goalkeeper. The team I would suppose is Liverpool, they aren't going too well lately but hopefully they will pick up in the future and get back to winnig ways, but if they dont I'll still support them. My favourite player is Lionel Messi, because he is the best player in the world and he plays the game so gracefully that he makes it look effortless when he plays. Soccer is also the biggest and most played sport in the world. </p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;"  class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> Is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, which is the team controlling the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the defense, which is the team without control of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and aims to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, and otherwise they turn over the football to the defense; if the offense succeeds in advancing ten yards or more, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. The biggest event in this sport is the Superbowl.</p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;"  class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the highest level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, usually 9 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup (4.25 inches in diameter). There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough , sand traps, and various hazards but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement. </p>

          <p style="font-size:x-large;"  class = "section"><Strong>Details:</Strong> is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court. While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith. A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is mandated when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by passing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. </p>
