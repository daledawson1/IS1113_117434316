	            I have travelled to spain three times in my life so far, I have been in Malaga, Madrid and Barcelona. Out of the three places my favourite place was Barcelona because of the beautiful scenery and the amazing culture in the area.

	           The spainish soccer team is one of the most successful in the world they have won the world cup one time in the competitions history. The domestic teams within spain are amongst the best in the world with Barcelona winning the club super cup in 2014 and 2016 and Real Madrid winning the same competition in 2015 and in 2017.

	            Las Vegas is the place that I would most like to visit because of the scenery in the city and the lifestyle there is on the strip in Las Vages. The strip is where all the huge hotels, casino's and nightclubs are. The main thing that attracts me to Las Vegas is the amount of famous night clubs over there, on the strip there is four of the top twenty nightclubs in the world, the "best" of these being hakkasan which is ranked number 2 in the world.

	            <br/>
	            On the strip in Las Vegas there is forty casinos in just six kilometers, this is absolutly crazy. There isnt even forty casinos in Ireland. This is a good and a bad thing but I would love just to walk through a few of them and feel the atmosphere in there I think it would be amazing.

	              <br/>
	              The place where I would most like to settle in is my home town in Fermoy. It is a small town in the north of Cork. My main reason for wanting to settle in Fermoy is because i grew up here and I love the G.A.A. team too much to leave.

	              <br/>
	              I have played hurling and football with Fermoy since I was eleven. I love the club and the sense of family that we have within the club. i would also like to raise a family in Fermoy because i was raised here and I would like to raise my kids in this town also, it is a quite town with good clubs for kids to join and there is lovely walk with fabulous walks and a beautiful river running right through the town.
