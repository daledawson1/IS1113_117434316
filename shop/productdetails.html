        <p class="cloudpara">-Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment, published as open source from version 3.0. It supports hundreds of programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go. It enables developers to get started with coding immediately with pre-configured workspaces, collaborate with their peers with collaborative coding features, and web development features like live preview and browser compatibility testing. A valid credit card is required for new user registration, and the service cannot be used without one. It is written almost entirely in JavaScript, and uses Node.js on the back-end. The editor component uses Ace. As of July 2014, it uses Docker containers for its workspaces, and is hosted on Google Compute Engine. Cloud9 had been acquired by Amazon in July 2016. Here at SugerSync you can get it for the low price of $200.</p>
