        <p class="definitioncc"><strong>Definition:</strong></br> the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.</p>

        <p class="howitworks"><strong>How cloud computing works:</strong></br> Cloud computing services all work a little differently, depending on the provider. But many provide a friendly, browser-based dashboard that makes it easier for IT professionals and developers to order resources and manage their accounts. Some cloud computing services are also designed to work with REST APIs and a command-line interface (CLI), giving developers multiple options.</p>

        <p class="usescc"><strong>Uses of cloud computing:</strong></br>You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don't realise it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations-from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits-are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons. Here are a few of the things you can do with the cloud:</br>-Create new apps and services</br>-Store, back up and recover data</br>-Host websites and blogs</br>-Stream audio and video</br>Deliver software on demand</br>-Analyse data for patterns and make predictions</p>
